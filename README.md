Car Rental System in C++ -🚗💻

👉 I’m excited to share my latest C++ project – a Console-Based Car Rental System, built using the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and File Handling! 🛠️

🔍 What it does:
This mini system provides a simple yet effective solution for managing a car rental business.

✅It includes features like:

✔️ Adding new cars
✔️ Renting a car
✔️ Viewing all available cars

✔️ The system is managed entirely by an admin, ensuring full control over the rental operations. All data is saved and loaded using file handling (.txt format), making it persistent and efficient! 📁👤 

✔️What I learned:

👉Through this project, I practiced all the core C++ concepts, from variables and functions to classes, constructors, and file I/O. It helped me improve my logic, structure, and approach to real-world problems using code. 💡

🚀Tech Stack:
✔️Language: C++
✔️Concepts: OOP, File Handling, Admin Panel
✔️Environment: Console-based UI

✔️This project not only strengthened my C++ foundations but also gave me a hands-on experience in system building and project structuring.
