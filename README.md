# Car-Rental-System-in-C-
(Working on the idea) â€“ I have practiced all core concepts of C++ and OOP, from variables to file handling. This project aims to provide a rental car service, including features to add cars, rent a car, and view available cars. The system is entirely admin-controlled for managing the complete rental process.
